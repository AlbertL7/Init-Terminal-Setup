I spent some time and found a nice Terminal set up with all the colors I like and realized this was like the 5th or 6th time I spent more than a couple hours doing this to get the terminal how I like it. 
So out of a need to save time I can run this script and have a functioning zsh terminal with autocompelet syntax highlighting, and all the colors I enjoy within minutes. 

If your anything like me and have trouble working on a computer that does not fit your color pallet you should use it, edit it, do whatever you want with it, its a big time saver in my opinion. 

## Use
Probably have ZSH aready install if not try it out anyway. I only tested it on a system that already had it, but the logic should be there to run it without I think.
You might get a bash trying to run a zsh script error.

'sudo su'

install zsh

'sudo apt install zsh'

'git clone https://github.com/AlbertL7/Init-Terminal-Setup.git'

'cd Init-Termainal-Setup.git'

'chmod +x SetTerminal.sh'

'./SetTerminal.sh'
