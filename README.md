I spent some time and found a nice Terminal set up with all the colors I like and realized this was like the 5th or 6th time I spent more than a couple hours doing this to get the terminal how I like it. 
So out of a need to save time I can run this script and have a functioning zsh terminal with autocompelet syntax highlighting, and all the colors I enjoy. 

Use it edit it, do whatever you want with it, its a big time saver in my opinion.
